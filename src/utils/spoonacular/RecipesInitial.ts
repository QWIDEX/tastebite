      "<ol><li>Set two racks in the middle of the oven. Preheat to 375F.</li><li>In a food processor, or bowl of an electric mixer, thoroughly mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and powder, salt, and sugar. While pulsing, or on low speed, add the butter, and then the egg. Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.</li><li>Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. (I started off with loonie sized chunks of dough which was too big. Its more like the size of a quarter. Remember, youre aiming for 50 to 60 of these individual wafers!) With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.</li><li>To make the cream, place butter and shortening in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.</li><li>To assemble the cookies, in a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch, round tip, pipe teaspoon-size blobs of cream into the center of one cookie. Place another cookie, equal in size to the first, on top of the cream. Lightly press, to work the filling evenly to the outsides of the cookie. (I dont think its entirely necessary to use a pastry bag. You could just spoon some icing on and squeeze between two wafers.) Continue this process until all the cookies have been sandwiched with cream.</li></ol>",

      "<ol><li>We'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. Add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients.</li><li>Run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. If the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. Add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. It should form a nice ball of dough. Once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes.</li><li>Cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes.</li><li>While your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. Grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. Now add in the garlic.</li><li>Next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms.</li><li>Let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. Give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach.</li><li>Let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat.</li><li>Now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli.</li><li>Rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness.</li><li>If you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday.</li><li>After you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta.</li><li>Brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. Seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face.</li><li>Grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. The pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked)</li><li>Grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. At this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic.</li><li>Now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble.</li><li>Drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated.</li><li>Serve them up with a little grated Parmesan or Romano over the top.</li></ol>",
